# CREDIT-CARD-FRAUD-DETECTION

Project Objective:
Task is to build a Machine Learning model that can:  
•	Detect fraudulent transactions based on transaction features like amount, timestamp, merchant info, etc.
•	Minimize false positives (legitimate transactions wrongly flagged as fraud),
•	Maximize detection accuracy,
•	Explain misclassifications.

This project builds a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions by analyzing transaction features, balancing data with SMOTE, and training a Random Forest classifier to achieve high fraud detection accuracy while minimizing false alarms.
